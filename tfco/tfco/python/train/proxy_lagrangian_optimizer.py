"""Constrained optimization using the proxy-Lagrangian formulation.

The code in this file uses the proxy-Lagrangian formulation to minimize a
constrained problem specified using the `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`
interface. Compared with the Lagrangian formulation, the proxy-Lagrangian is the
more complex and expensive option, although it has more theoretical backing.
Generally, the extra computational cost of using the proxy-Lagrangian
formuilation will be small, assuming that the minibatch size and complexity of
the model are sufficiently large compared to the number of constraints. In this
case, we recommend it over the Lagrangian formulation.

At least in theory, external regret minimization of the Lagrangian formulation
could converge more slowly than swap regret minimization using the
proxy-Lagrangian formulation, assuming that the `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`
we're optimizing uses "proxy_constraints".

For more specifics, please refer to:

The proxy-Lagrangian formulation can be found in Definition 2, and is discussed
in Section 4. If using multiplicative updates to minimize swap regret (the
update_type and regret_type constructor parameters), the algorithm is most
similar to Algorithm 2 in Section 4, with the difference being that it uses
`Optimizer`s, instead of SGD, for the "inner" updates. Instead of swap regret,
one can alternatively use external regret, and instead of multiplicative
updates, one can alternatively use additive updates, if desired.

  The formulation used here is the so-called "proxy-Lagrangian"
  formulation, which can be found in Definition 2, and is discussed in Section
  4. If using multiplicative updates to minimize swap regret (the update_type
  and regret_type constructor parameters), the algorithm is most similar to
  Algorithm 2 in Section 4, with the difference being that it uses
  `Optimizer`s, instead of SGD, for the "inner" updates. Instead of swap regret,
  one can alternatively use external regret, and instead of multiplicative
  updates, one can alternatively use additive updates, if desired.

  In addition to a loss function, this method returns a function returning a
  list of operations that should be executed before each iteration
  ("update_ops"), and a `tf.Variable` containing the internal proxy-Lagrangian
  state (the analogue of the Lagrange multipliers).

  In graph mode, the result of this update_ops function could be "attached" to
  the train_op using tf.control_dependencies. In eager mode, it should be called
  before each iteration. Likewise, you should make sure to differentiate w.r.t.
  the state, e.g. by including it in the var_list that you pass to an
  `Optimizer`'s minimize() method.

  For example, in graph mode, your code could look like this:

  ```python
  # We ignore the returned state, since we won't provide a var_list to the
  # Optimizer's minimize() method.
  loss_fn, update_ops_fn, _ = create_loss(formulation, minimization_problem)

  optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer()
  with tf.control_dependencies(update_ops_fn()):
    # Since we don't provide a var_list, we'll just differentiate w.r.t. all
    # trainable variables, including the state.
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss_fn())

  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
    for iteration in xrange(num_iterations):
      session.run(train_op)
  ```

  while in eager mode, it could look like this:

  ```python
  loss_fn, update_ops_fn, state_variable = create_loss(formulation,
      minimization_problem)

  # Assuming that we already have a var_list containing the model parameters.
  var_list += minimization_problem.trainable_variables
  var_list.append(state_variable)

  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD()

  for iteration in xrange(num_iterations):
    update_ops_fn()
    optimizer.minimize(loss_fn, var_list=var_list)
  ```

  Args:
    minimization_problem: `ConstrainedMinimizationProblem`, the problem to
      optimize.
    regret_type: string, either "external" or "swap", determines what type of
      regret minimization to perform when updating the constraint/objective
      weights (the analogues of the Lagrange multipliers). This parameter has
      *no effect* on the optimization of the model parameters. Defaults to
      "swap".
    update_type: string, either "additive" or "multiplicative", determines what
      type of updates to use for maximizing over the constraint/objective
      weights (the analogues of the Lagrange multipliers). This parameter has
      *no effect* on the optimization of the model parameters. Defaults to
      "multiplicative".
    minimum_multiplier_radius: optional float in the range (0,1), only allowed
      if update_type="multiplicative". The constraint/objective weights will be
      lower bounded by "minimum_multiplier_radius" divided by one plus the
      number of constraints. Defaults to 10^-3.
    initial_multiplier_radius: optional float in the range [0,1], the initial
      value of each constraint weight (i.e. excluding the weight associated with
      the objective) will be "initial_multiplier_radius" divided by one plus the
      number of constraints. If update_type="multiplicative", it defaults to the
      value of minimum_multiplier_radius (and must be no smaller than
      minimum_multiplier_radius if it's explicitly specified), and defaults to
      zero if update_type="additive".
    dual_scale: optional float defaulting to 1, a multiplicative scaling factor
      applied to gradients w.r.t. the internal state.

  Returns:
    A (loss_fn, update_ops_fn, state_variable) tuple, where loss_fn is a nullary
    function returning a `Tensor` that can be minimized to optimize the
    constrained problem, update_ops_fn is a nullary function that returns a list
    of operations that should be executed before each training iteration, and
    state_variable is a `tf.Variable` containing the internal state of the
    proxy-Lagrangian formulation.
