"""Contains the `Constraint` and `ConstraintList` classes.

A `Constraint` is nothing but a thin wrapper around an `Expression`, and
represents the constraint that the wrapped `Expression` should be non-positive.

A `ConstraintList` is basically a stripped-down list of `Constraint` objects,
with the additional property that if one attempts to add a duplicate
`Constraint` to the list, then it will be ignored. In the past, we used a set,
but realized that it's desirable for the constraints to appear in the resulting
`RateMinimizationProblem` in the order in which they were added.
