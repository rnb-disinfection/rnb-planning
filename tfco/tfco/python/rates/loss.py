"""Contains loss functions for use in rate constraints.

The "rates" used in this library represent e.g. the true positive rate, which is
the proportion of positively-labeled examples on which the model makes a
positive prediction. We cannot optimize over such rates directly, since the
indicator function for "do we make a positive prediction on this example" is
discontinuous, and hence not differentiable. Hence, we relax this indicator
function using a loss function, several alternatives for which are defined in
this file.
