"""Contains the `BasicExpression` class.

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to construct and optimize ML
problems for which the goal is to minimize a linear combination of rates,
subject to zero or more constraints on linear combinations of rates. That is:

  minimize:  c11 * rate11 + c12 * rate12 + ... + tensor1
  such that: c21 * rate21 + c22 * rate22 + ... + tensor2 <= 0
             c31 * rate31 + c32 * rate32 + ... + tensor3 <= 0
             ...

Each rate is e.g. an error rate, positive prediction rate, false negative rate
on a certain slice of the data, and so on.

The objective and constraint functions are each represented by an `Expression`,
which captures a linear combination of `Term`s and scalar `Tensor`s. A `Term`
represents the proportion of time that a certain event occurs on a subset of the
data. For example, a `Term` might represent the positive prediction rate on the
set of negatively-labeled examples (the false positive rate).

The above description is somewhat oversimplified. Most relevantly here, an
`Expression` object actually consists of two `BasicExpression` objects: one for
the "penalty" portion of the problem (which is used when optimizing the model
parameters), and the other for the "constraint" portion (used when optimizing
the constraints, e.g. the Lagrange multipliers, if using the Lagrangian
formulation). It is the `BasicExpression` object that actually represents linear
combinations of `Term`s, and it contains some additional logic for combining
"compatible" `Term`s.

  The `BasicExpression` object is, along with `Expression`, one of the two core
