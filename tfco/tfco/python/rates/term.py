"""Contains `Term`s for use in rate constraints.

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to construct and optimize ML
problems for which the goal is to minimize a linear combination of rates,
subject to zero or more constraints on linear combinations of rates. That is:

  minimize:  c11 * rate11 + c12 * rate12 + ... + tensor1
  such that: c21 * rate21 + c22 * rate22 + ... + tensor2 <= 0
             c31 * rate31 + c32 * rate32 + ... + tensor3 <= 0
             ...

Each rate is e.g. an error rate, positive prediction rate, false negative rate
on a certain slice of the data, and so on.

The objective and constraint functions are each represented by an `Expression`,
which captures a linear combination of `Term`s and scalar `Tensor`s. A `Term`
represents the proportion of time that a certain event occurs on a subset of the
data. For example, a `Term` might represent the positive prediction rate on the
set of negatively-labeled examples (the false positive rate). All `Term`s have
an associated loss. This could be the zero-one loss (if we wanted, for example,
the exact false positive rate, as above), or a hinge approximation, or something
else.

The above description is somewhat oversimplified--there are a number of
additional complications. For one, an `Expression` object actually consists of
two `BasicExpression` objects: one for the "penalty" portion of the problem
(which is used when optimizing the model parameters), and the other for the
"constraint" portion (used when optimizing the constraints, e.g. the Lagrange
multipliers, if using the Lagrangian formulation). It is the `BasicExpression`
object that actually represents linear combinations of `Term`s, and it contains
some additional logic for combining "compatible" `Term`s.

class _RatioWeights(helpers.RateObject):
  """Object representing a `Tensor` of example weights for a ratio or ratios.

  This is a helper class which is used to find weights for sums of ratios. For
  example, if we want to compute the average positive prediction rate on a
  subset of the data (here, 1{} is an indicator function):
    (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in numerator_subset} 1{predictions[i] > 0})
        / (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in denominator_subset})
  then the "evaluate" method will return a `Tensor` of ratio_weights such that:
    ratio_weights[j] = weights[j] 1{j in numerator_subset}
        / (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in denominator_subset})
  with the consequence that the average positive prediction rate on this subset
  can be written as:
    mean_i ratio_weights[i] 1{predictions[i] > 0}
  such ratio objects can be constructed using the "ratio" class method.

  For a single ratio, the "evaluate" method will return the ratio_weights[]
  `Tensor`, as defined above. However, this class also supports linear
  combinations of ratios, each of which potentially has its own "weights",
  "numerator_subset" and "denominator_subset". To this end, it supports
  arithmetic operations. For example, the sum of two `_RatioWeights`s evaluates
  to the sum of the evaluations of the two `_RatioWeights`s. Subtraction,
  negation, scalar multiplication, and scalar division, are also supported.

  Overall, taking linear combinations into account, the quantities represented
  by this class take the form:
    ratio_weights[j] = sum_k c_k weights_k[j] 1{j in numerator_subset_k}
        / (mean_i weights_k[i] 1{i in denominator_subset_k})

class BinaryClassificationTerm(Term):
  """`Term` object representing a binary classification rate.

  This class represents a rate (and linear combinations of "compatible" rates,
  which will be discussed later). Every rate is represented in terms of positive
  and negative prediction rates on a subset of the dataset:
    ppr = (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in numerator_subset} 1{predictions[i] > 0})
        / (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in denominator_subset})
    npr = (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in numerator_subset} 1{predictions[i] < 0})
        / (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in denominator_subset})
    rate = positive_coefficient * ppr + negative_coefficient * npr
  The "positive_coefficient * ppr" and "negative_coefficient * npr" quantities,
  above, can be written in the form of `_RatioWeights` objects as:
    positive_term = positive_coefficient * ppr
        = (mean_i positive_ratio_weights[i] 1{predictions[i] > 0})
    negative_term = negative_coefficient * ppr
        = (mean_i negative_ratio_weights[i] 1{predictions[i] < 0})
    rate = positive_term + negative_term
  where:
    ratio_weights[j] = weights[j] 1{j in numerator_subset}
        / (mean_i weights[i] 1{i in denominator_subset})
    positive_ratio_weights = positive_coefficient * ratio_weights
    negative_ratio_weights = negative_coefficient * ratio_weights
  A `BinaryClassificationTerm` contains the two `_RatioWeights` objects. When
  constructed using the "ratio" method, these two objects will be exactly the
  "positive_ratio_weights" and "negative_ratio_weights" weights defined above
  (things get more complicated, however, once we take linear combinations of
  `BinaryClassificationTerm`s into account).

  In addition to the predictions and weights discussed above, a
  `BinaryClassificationTerm` also has an associated loss object (of type
  `BinaryClassificationLoss`), which is used to approximate the positive and
  negative prediction indicators. For example, if we're using the hinge loss,
  then instead of defining ppr and npr in terms of "1{predictions[i] > 0}" and
  "1{predictions[i] < 0}", a hinge approximation to these indicators will be
  used instead.

  Several arithmetic operations are overloaded: scalar multiplication, scalar
  division, and negation of `BinaryClassificationTerm`s yields new
  `BinaryClassificationTerm`s on which the specified operation has been
  performed. Binary operations (addition and subtraction) are more complicated:
  they can *only* be applied to "compatible" objects, i.e. the objects to be
  added or subtracted must both be `BinaryClassificationTerm`s, both have the
  same set of predictions, and both use the same loss function. If these
  conditions are satisfied, then the `BinaryClassificationTerm`s can be added or
  subtracted by simply adding or subtracting the contained `_RatioWeights`
  objects.

  This "compatibility" condition is checked using the "key" method. If two
  `Term`s have the same keys, then they may be combined using a binary
  arithmetic operation. This is used by the `BasicExpression` object, which
  represents arbitrary linear combinations of `Term`s, to identify compatible
  `Term`s by storing its `Term`s in a dictionary, with its keys taken from the
  "key" method.

  The benefit of combining compatible terms is that, when using a relaxed loss
  (e.g. a hinge) it enables us to use a tighter approximation to the true
  (zero-one based) rate, since we're only performing the loss approximation
  *once*, after we've simplified as much as possible, instead of performing a
  separate approximation for each component rate.
