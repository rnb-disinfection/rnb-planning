"""Contains the `Expression` class.

The purpose of this library is to make it easy to construct and optimize ML
problems for which the goal is to minimize a linear combination of rates,
subject to zero or more constraints on linear combinations of rates. That is:

  minimize:  c11 * rate11 + c12 * rate12 + ... + tensor1
  such that: c21 * rate21 + c22 * rate22 + ... + tensor2 <= 0
             c31 * rate31 + c32 * rate32 + ... + tensor3 <= 0
             ...

Each rate is e.g. an error rate, positive prediction rate, false negative rate
on a certain slice of the data, and so on.

The objective and constraint functions are each represented by an `Expression`,
which captures a linear combination of `Term`s and scalar `Tensor`s. A `Term`
represents the proportion of time that a certain event occurs on a subset of the
data. For example, a `Term` might represent the positive prediction rate on the
set of negatively-labeled examples (the false positive rate).

The above description is somewhat oversimplified. Most relevantly here, an
`Expression` object actually consists of two `BasicExpression` objects: one for
the "penalty" portion of the problem (which is used when optimizing the model
parameters), and the other for the "constraint" portion (used when optimizing
the constraints, e.g. the Lagrange multipliers, if using the Lagrangian
formulation). In other words, an `Expression` needs to know not only exactly
what quantity it represents (the "constraints" portion), but also a
{sub,super}differentiable approximation of it (the "penalty" portion).

  """Represents an expression that can be penalized or constrained.

  An `Expression`, like a `BasicExpression`, represents a linear combination of
  terms. However, it actually includes *two* `BasicExpression`s, one of
  which--the "penalty" portion--is used when the expression is being minimized
  (in the objective function) or penalized (to satisfy a constraint), and the
  second of which--the "constraint" portion--is used when the expression is
  being constrained.

  Typically, the "penalty" and "constraint" portions will be different
  approximations of the same quantity, e.g. the latter could be a zero-one-based
  rate (say, a false positive rate), and the former a hinge approximation of it.

  In addition, an `Expression` can (optionally) contain a set of associated
  constraints. Technically, these can be anything: they're simply additional
  constraints, which may or may not have anything to do with the `Expression` to
  which they're attached. In practice, they'll usually represent conditions that
  are required for the associated `Expression` to make sense. For example, we
  could construct an `Expression` representing "the false positive rate of f(x)
  at the threshold for which the true positive rate is at least 0.9" with the
  expression being "the false positive rate of f(x) - t", and the extra
  constraint being "the true positive rate of f(x) - t is at least 0.9", where
  "t" is an implicit threshold. These extra constraints will ultimately be
  included in any optimization problem that includes the associated `Expression`
  (or an `Expression` derived from it).
