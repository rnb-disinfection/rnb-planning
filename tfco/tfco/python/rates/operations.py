  The reason an `Expression` contains two `BasicExpression`s is that the
  "penalty" `BasicExpression` will be differentiable, while the "constraint"
  `BasicExpression` need not be. During optimization, the former will be used
  whenever we need to take gradients, and the latter otherwise.

  Args:
    penalty_tensor: scalar `Tensor`, the quantity to store in the "penalty"
      portion of the result (and also the "constraint" portion, if
