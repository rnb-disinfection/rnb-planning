    "The purpose of these tutorials is two-fold. One one hand these tutorials discuss the basics of the eTaSL constraint-based task specification language and controller.  On the other hand, it is a demonstration of the use of the eTaSL python driver.  Typically, this python driver is not used in a real-time robot application.  For real-time purposes eTaSL RTT is preferred (an Orocos RTT component).  The python driver is mostly used for rapid prototyping and analysis.  It can be easily used in *Jupyter notebooks*.\n",

    "- [Weights 2](weights_2.ipynb), exploring the exact conditions in which optimal feedforward is generated when using changing weights.\n",
    "- [Weights_3](weights_3.ipynb), gives an example where there is no optimal feedforward and there is a tracking error.\n",
