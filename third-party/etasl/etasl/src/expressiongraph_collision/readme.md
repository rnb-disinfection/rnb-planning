# Expressiongraph_Collision

## Introduction

Uses the bullet library to provide distance computation between convex
objects.  This is used to provide collision avoidance in an example application.

The underlying method is the GJK algorithm, which is a very efficient way to compute the
distance between two convex objects. 


## Installation

Requires the installation of bullet:
``` 
sudo apt-get install libbullet-dev
```

meshlab is necessary to run the script generate_capsules.sh.  It is however
not necessary to run this script to show the examples.


## Running examples


robot_flexfellow.lua contains the robot model and the collision model.  The 
collision model is formulated as a number of shapes and a list of pairs with
indices refering to the shapes.  The collision is checked for each pair.

### example.launch
```
roslaunch expressiongraph_collision example.launch
```
This example shows the collision avoidance model for the LBR-IIWA robot.
The capsules describing the links of the LBR-IWWA robot are generated by the
extract_capsules program in the examples directory and the generate_capsules.sh
script in the meshes directory.  This program extracts capsule parameters (length/radius)
while assuming the axis of the capsule given.  It also generates an .obj file to visualize
the capsule.  The collision information of the robot is adapted such that the collision
model can be visualized.  This example is also an example of using eTaSL with a 
finite state machine, together with the grouping mechanism to activate/deactivate groups.

### cube_on_plane.launch
```
roslaunch expressiongraph_collision cube_on_plane.launch
```
A somewhat extremer example where a cube-tool is dragged along the base with different
kinds of contact situations between the tool, the robot and the base.  This example
contains three motions: A) moving down such that the tool makes contact with the base
B) drag tool along base by moving joint 1.  C) move joint 4 to drag it further along
the base and the pole.



## Description of convex geometries

See the collision latex document in the doc directory for the underlying methodology
and a list of provided objects.

## Useful tools

- Meshlab (manipulation of meshes, can also generate implicit surfaces)
- MathMod (implicit surfaces, can export to wavefront .obj file)
- Blender
