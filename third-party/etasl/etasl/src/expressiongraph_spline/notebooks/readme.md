Usage of makefile:
-----------------

To run the notebooks, do not forget to initialize ros and run the setluapaths script in the
root directory of this package, using:
	source ../setluapath.sh

IPython notebooks store also the results of the computations in the notebook.
In case of plots or movies, these files can be big and contain binary data not
very suited for version control.
This is a script to convert notebooks to/from a cleaned version of the notebooks.
The cleaned version is better suited for version control. 
'make create' will create .ipynb files from the cleaned versions .clean_ipynb
'make save' will create .clean_ipynb files from the .ipynb files.
'make clean' will delete all files that are generated by the notebooks.
'make html' will create a static version of the notebooks (you will have to 
            run them once to create the output).
