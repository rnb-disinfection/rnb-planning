# Expression graph library.


This library provides expression trees for representation of geometric expressions and automatic differentiation
of these expressions.  This enables to write down geometric expressions at the position level, and automatically 
compute Jacobians and higher order derivatives efficiently and without loss of precision.
The library is built upon the KDL library and uses the same geometric primitives.  Most operators and functions for
the basic primitives of KDL, have an equivalent in the expression tree library.
