\b expressiongraph_context_lua

<!-- 
Provide an overview of your package.
-->

Expressiongraph_context_lua contains the lua binding to the context
data-structure, together with some higher-level lua libraries.

Together this constitutes the eTaSL language for task specification based
on expressiongraphs.

See also the <b>expressiongraph_iros_2014</b> example and his documentation.

- It is also required to install lua5.1 and the luabind library
- I do not have a lot of experience installing this on different computers, so any comments regarding installation
  are welcome.
- setluapath.sh script has to be adapted with your specific paths for LUA and urdf files.  
- Be sure to run this script before running the examples using "source setluapath.sh" such that 
  the environment variables indicating the search paths for lua scripts and urdf files are defined
  in the current shell.
