Introduction
-------------

This package offers B-spline functionality in eTaSL.  B-splines
are spline basis-functions with compact support and can be used
to:

    - specify trajectories using Bezier curves or bsplines;
    - describe the variations on top of a given trajectory;
    - formulate optimization problems over a time horizon.
   

How to use

        function augknots( knots, degree)

        INPUTS:
            knots : a table representing the knot vector
            degree: the degree (and multiplicity of the the first and last element
                    of the result).
        OUTPUTS:
            returns an augmented knot vector, i.e. a knot vector with the _exact_
            multiplicity of the first and last element equal to degree.

                    up to derivative (degree-multiplicity).
                    It should start and end with knots of multiplicity "degree" (called an augmented 
                    knot vector in B-spline literature).
