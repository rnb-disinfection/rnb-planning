-------

catkinized package, based upon lua 5.1 (for compatibility with orocos-rtt)
luabind in ubuntu 14.04 only supports lua5.2, therefore a seperately compiled

Catkinized the package

To be verified, especially wrt "install"

Also uses catkins env-hooks, such that the lua path is automatically
set, and also the path itself.
